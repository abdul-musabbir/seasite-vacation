          "Seaside Beach Vacations, just a quick review to let you know how much of a great time we had. Everything was as it was pictured. The queen beds were all fantastic. The large backyard was great for our group; there was plenty of seating. The parking was amazing; we had six cars in the driveway. I could see other groups driving around looking for parking. Wi-Fi was great, very strong, and all the kids thought it was in a great location.",

          "Thanks for a great week. We had everything we needed. The beds were all very comfortable. It was really the perfect location for the kids, for the adults, the restaurants, the boardwalk, the wheels, the rides, and the beach—crazy fun! Thanks again. Also, the dogs loved the fenced-in large space and that they could hang out with us in the backyard, and we didn't have any worries because it was nicely fenced in.",

          "We had such a nice time. Friends and family loved it! Also, the jacuzzi was the highlight. The house is so tastefully decorated, with flat-screen TVs in every room—just could not beat the accommodations. The location is absolutely amazing! We were half a block from three different beaches. There's great seating—outdoor and indoor seating areas, fire pit, and plenty of off-street parking. The owner even had wine and snacks waiting for us upon arrival.",

          "What a great place to spend Saint Patrick's Day weekend! Unbelievable parade. The house was everything we could have asked for—right at the beach, all the good restaurants and bars were right there. We never had to get in the car. The parade was half a block away, and it was fantastic! How did you guys find such a great spot?",

Barbecues were all great—never had to use any of the cars. Half a block walk to everything—restaurants, rides, wheels. Adults enjoyed themselves, kids enjoyed themselves—it was just great.",

All the rides and wheels were there. The house was spotless, all beautifully renovated. Had two front decks—one with a fire pit and great seating. Good parking. Rooms had comfortable beds, full bath, washer, dryer. Great back area to hang out, great front area to hang out. We're coming back again!",

Nice little seating area in the backyard with seating and a gas grill. Good parking, great location, just a lot of fun. Fully stocked kitchen, bathroom, washer, dryer.

The beds were comfortable, the living room was perfect, the big-screen TV was perfect. The front sitting area with the grill was just what we needed. And when you can walk 100 feet and be on the boardwalk and the beach, you can't beat that! Had a wonderful, wonderful time. Thank you!",
